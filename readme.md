# simplerc

Minimalistic dotfiles that I pull into throwaway posix VMs for a semi-consistent experience.

Copy `autoload/` directory to `~/.vim/` directory.

Don't forget to install `tmux` and then `tpm`:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
```

Might need:

```
$ tmux source ~/.tmux.conf
```

And then `prefix + I`.
